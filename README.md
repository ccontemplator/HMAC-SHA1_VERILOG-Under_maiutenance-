# verilog_HMAC-SHA1

The SHA1 algorithm is done, however with a little modification, so the hashed texts won't match those generated by the stardard SHA-1.

The difference lies in the non-blocking assignments of the w0~w79, incurring the discrepancies with the stardand SHA-1 outcome.

HMAC module will be made in the future.
